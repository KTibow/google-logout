# google-logout
A simple bit of code that can do a lot. It signs you out of your Google account, and then rickrolls you.  
To use, go to [https://ktibow.github.io/google-logout/](https://ktibow.github.io/google-logout/). Or for a badusb, just make it open the page. Or for a link, just link to that, and maybe disguise it as something like
```
I found this really cool microcontroller! It's called an Arduino, and you can purchase them right now at https://store.arduino.cc/usa/!
```
But instead of having `https://store.arduino.cc/usa/` link to `https://store.arduino.cc/usa/`, it links to `https://ktibow.github.io/google-logout/`.
  
If you want to put this on another url, just take the `index.html` file.
I have a payload in `google_logout.ino` to run on a Arduino Leonardo (why a leonardo? because I had that, and I didn't want to waste time ordering a professional badusb), to act as a badusb. It could just as easily work on a Rubber Ducky or a Malduino, too.
  
Remember this is under the No-Harm license (adapted from the MIT license), which means that I have no liability for anything, and you shouldn't knowingly cause harm, except in the case of harm that can be easily fixed. Use at your own risk. Also, not everybody knows their Google Password, so for some people this could be a bigger deal.  
Other than that, this is a mostly harmless little prank. Enjoy!
